# Earthquake Challenge

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates location on Earth, and to see all earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 in the last 7 days. 

## Overview of Project

To complete this project we used a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website to retrieve coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes for the last 7 days. Using JavaScript, Leaflet.js and GeoJSON data, the map will show 3 different overlays consisting of: All Earthquakes, Major Earthquakes, and Tectonic Plates. Toggling between the 3 will show different sets of data. A legend is added to visually show magnitudes, in addition there are 3 different map styles.
